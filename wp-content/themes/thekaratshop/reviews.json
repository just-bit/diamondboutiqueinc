My father bought my mother\u2019s engagement ring at The Karat Shop back when they were in their early 20s and he told me that, if the store was still around, I should go and check it out. As a younger guy I had absolutely no idea what I was doing when I first walked into the store, however the staff was extremely knowledgeable and taught me everything I needed to know so that way when I walked out I felt like an expert! Not only was I provided with endless options to achieve what I wanted, I was also pleasantly surprised with how fair the prices were. There was not a single moment where I felt that I was being taken advantage of or \u201cripped off\u201d. When I figured out what I wanted and agreed on a price, I was able to make a convenient appointment with the jeweler for the following week. They allowed me to sit in front of the jewelers station and watch him create my ring. It was so great to watch, and he really is a magician when it comes to his craft. The entire time I felt very assured that I was going to receive a masterpiece, and at the end my feelings were correct! I received an absolutely gorgeous ring within an hour at a great price! I highly recommend The Karat Shop to anyone who is looking for high quality jewelry, as well as the highest quality of customer service.
