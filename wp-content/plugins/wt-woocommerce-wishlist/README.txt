* Customize WooCommerce marketing campaign - Data derived from wishlists help customize your marketing campaign in order to promote a certain product or to appeal to a certain group of individuals in a particular area.
* Fewer returns - Wishlists include products that the customers really want ie; they gave enough time over the decision to purchase the product by putting it on the wishlist. Thus returns will be very less compared to an instant purchase.
* Increases sale - Persuading potential customers to purchase by providing discounts and offers on the items of their WooCommerce wishlist will increase the sales revenue.

Customers always find something in the store that they wish to buy but do not intend to buy now. This presents the opportunity for the store owners by letting their customers make a note of the product that they are considering buying.

Wishlist is the best way to know your customer's likes and dislikes and keep them attracted to your store forever. Therefore timely analysis of wishlists and putting those conclusions to develop marketing strategies will help a long way in the growth of your WooCommerce store.
